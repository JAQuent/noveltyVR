In the alphabetical task, you need to decide whether the first and the last letter are in alphabetical order (non-alphabetical vs. alphabetical). A word starting with B but ending on A is non-alphabetical. The same is true for a word starting and ending with the same letter. If a word - for instance - starts with A and ends on Y, it's alphabetical. You press the left control key for non-alphabetical words and the right control key for alphabetical words. Please use one finger from each hand.\n\nPress space to continue.
